A twist on the classic game Pong, this is a two-player competitive game with some famous recognizable characters!


Requires Java 17 for Kilt Graphics
The program starts by running CustodyBattle.Java which contains the main class.
We have three classes; the main class, ball and paddle.
This project implements GraphicsGroups in both the ball and paddle class. 
The ball class creates a new ball, with specific dimensions and color to appear on the canvas. It keeps track of the ball by getting the X and Y coordinates. The ball speed is set as an instance variable. 
The paddle class creates two rectangles, with images fixed on top of them. Movement of the paddles is controlled by WS and the up-arrow and the bottom-arrow. This class generates the paddles within a certain height. 
The main class animates both the ball and paddle for movement, and updates the score using a point counter boolean
by increments of $100. This class determines whether the ball has hit any of the paddles, and reflects the ball if it does. This class checks for which keys were pressed, putting them within a list and moving the paddles.

This project is a fusion of 3 different animated characters from alternate universes. The concept of the game is within the title of the game, "Custody Battle", where we can see two terrible parents fighting over an innocent baby. The important underlying message of this project is to highlight the issues of divorce, maintaining that it is never the child's fault in any scenario if a custody battle ever happens.
