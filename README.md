# Custody Battle!

This project is based off the classic original game Pong, created in 1972. 
However, we take a twist on this game, ours being called Custody Battle. 
This game is a competitive two player game, where players attempt to gain points/money in a court battle for the child. 

This project implements GraphicsGroups to move the ball and paddle within the canvas.
